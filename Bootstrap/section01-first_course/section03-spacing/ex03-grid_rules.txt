-   Rows must be placed within a .container (fixed-width) or .container-fluid (full-width) for 
proper alignment and padding;

-   Use rows to create horizontal groups of columns;

-   Content should be placed within columns, and only columns may be immediate children of rows;

-   Predefined classes like .row and .col-sm-4 are available for quickly making grid layouts;

-   Columns create gutters (gaps between column content) via padding. That padding is offset in 
rows for the first and last column via negative margin on .rows;

-   Grid columns are created by specifying the number of 12 available columns you wish to span. 
For example, three equal columns would use three .col-sm-4;

-   Column widths are in percentage, so they are always fluid and sized relative to their parent 
element;

-   The biggest difference between Bootstrap 3 and Bootstrap 4 is that Bootstrap 4 uses flexbox, 
instead of floats. One big advantage with flexbox is that grid columns without a specified width 
will automatically layout as "equal width columns" (and equal height). Example: Three elements 
with .col-sm will each automatically be 33.33% wide from the small breakpoint and up.
